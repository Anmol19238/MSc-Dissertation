# Handling Missing Data in Classification and Clustering

This project explores how different techniques can manage missing data in machine learning tasks, specifically for classification and clustering. We evaluate a range of methods, from traditional approaches like Multiple Imputation and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to advanced deep learning models like GAIN and MIDA.

## Project Overview

- **Datasets**: 
  - Heart disease prediction (classification)
  - Natural disasters analysis (clustering)
  
- **Missing Data Patterns**:
  - Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
  - Missing at Random (MAR)
  - Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

- **Imputation Methods**:
  - Multiple Imputation
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - GAIN
  - MIDA
  - [And others as detailed in the dissertation]

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest for classification
  - K-means for clustering

## Key Findings

Traditional methods like Multiple Imputation and KNN performed consistently well across various missing data patterns. While deep learning methods such as GAIN and MIDA showed potential, they were hindered by computational limitations in this study.
