#Handling Missing Data in Classification and Clustering
This project looks at how different techniques can deal with missing data in machine learning, specifically for tasks like classification and clustering. We compare a variety of methods, from traditional approaches like Multiple Imputation and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to more advanced deep learning methods such as GAIN and MIDA.

#Project Overview
-> Datasets: We use two datasets: one for predicting heart disease (classification) and another that analyzes natural disasters (clustering).
-> Missing Data Patterns: We simulate missing data using three common patterns: Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR).
-> Imputation Methods: Seven different imputation techniques are applied to handle the missing data.
-> Machine Learning Models: We use Random Forest for classification and K-means for clustering.
-> Key Findings
Traditional methods like Multiple Imputation and KNN were generally more reliable, while deep learning approaches like GAIN and MIDA showed promise but faced computational challenges.
